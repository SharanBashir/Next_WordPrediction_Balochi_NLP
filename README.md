# Balochi NLP Toolkit: N-gram Based Next Word Prediction

This project focuses on next-word prediction in the Balochi language using NLP techniques.


## Features

- Tokenizes and processes Balochi sentences.
- Builds n-gram models (bigrams, trigrams, quadgrams).
- Uses **Lidstone smoothing** to train the language model.
- Calculates **perplexity** on unseen test data.
- Visualizes most frequent n-grams using **Plotly**.
- Supports extending to other smoothing techniques like Laplace or Kneser-Ney.
